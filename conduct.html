        <h2 id="about">About the Code of Conduct</h2>
    
        <h3 id="why">Why have a Code of Conduct?</h3>
    
        <p>
          Online communities include people from many different backgrounds.
          The MobileBayTech.org team are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
          environment for all, regardless of age, disability, gender, nationality, race,
          religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          The first goal of the Code of Conduct is to specify a baseline standard
          of behavior so that people with different social values and communication
          styles can talk about technology and programming effectively, productively, and respectfully.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          The second goal is to provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the
          community when they arise.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          The third goal of the Code of Conduct is to make our community welcoming to
          people from different backgrounds.
          Diversity is critical to the project; for MobileBayTech.org to be successful, it needs
          contributors and users from all backgrounds.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          With that said, a healthy community must allow for disagreement and debate.
          The Code of Conduct is not a mechanism for people to silence others with whom
          they disagree.
        </p>
    
        <h3 id="spaces">Where does the Code of Conduct apply?</h3>
    
        <p>
          If you participate in or contribute to MobileBayTech.org in any way,
          you are encouraged to follow the Code of Conduct while doing so.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Explicit enforcement of the Code of Conduct applies to the
          official MobileBayTech.org website and Slack team chat (“MobileBayTech.org spaces”):
        </p>
    
        <div class="main">
        <ul>
          <li>The <a href="http://mobilebaytech.org">MobileBayTech.org</a> website.</li>
          <li>The Louisville <a href="https://mobilebaytech.slack.com/">Slack team</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    
    
        <h2 id="values">MobileBayTech.org values</h2>
    
        <p>
          These are the values to which people in the MobileBayTech.org community should aspire.
        </p>
    
        <ul>
          <li>Be friendly and welcoming</li>
          <li>Be patient
            <ul>
              <li>Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not
                everyone is using their native language.
                (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Be thoughtful
            <ul>
              <li>Productive communication requires effort.
                Think about how your words will be interpreted.</li>
              <li>Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Be respectful
            <ul>
              <li>In particular, respect differences of opinion.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Be charitable
            <ul>
              <li>Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.</li>
              <li>When we do disagree, try to understand why.</li>
              <li>Be very careful when discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues;
                Stay polite and avoid escalations.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Avoid destructive behavior:
            <ul>
              <li>Unconstructive criticism: don't merely decry the current state of affairs;
                offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.</li>
              <li>Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)</li>
              <li>Intentional Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral and
                environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative
                slights and insults to a person or group.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
          People are complicated.
          You should expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others;
          when this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame.
          Try not to take offense where no offense was intended.
          Give people the benefit of the doubt.
          Even if the intent was to provoke, do not rise to it.
          It is the responsibility of <i>all parties</i> to de-escalate conflict when it arises.
        </p>
    
        <h2 id="unwelcome_behavior">Unwelcome behavior</h2>
    
        <p>
          These actions are explicitly forbidden in MobileBayTech.org spaces:
        </p>
    
        <ul>
          <li>Insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks. Personal attacks.</li>
          <li>Discrimination based on age, disability, gender, nationality, race,
            religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.</li>
          <li>Bullying or systematic harassment.</li>
          <li>Unwelcome sexual advances.</li>
          <li>Incitement to any of these.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2 id="moderation">Moderation</h2>
    
        <p>
          The MobileBayTech.org spaces are not free speech venues; they are for discussion about technology and programming.
          These spaces have moderators.
          The goal of the moderators is to facilitate civil discussion about technology and programming.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          When using the official MobileBayTech.org spaces you should act in the spirit of “human
          values”.
          If you conduct yourself in a way that is explicitly forbidden by the CoC,
          you will be warned and asked to stop.
          If you do not stop, you will be removed from our community spaces temporarily.
          Repeated, wilful breaches of the CoC will result in a permanent ban.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members.
          If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less
          leeway than others, and should expect to be removed from their position if they
          cannot adhere to the CoC.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Complaints about moderator actions must be handled using the reporting process
          below.
        </p>
    
        <h2 id="reporting">Reporting issues</h2>
    
        <p>
          The Code of Conduct Working Group is a group of people that represent the MobileBayTech.org
          community. They are responsible for handling conduct-related issues.
          Their purpose is to de-escalate conflicts and try to resolve issues to the
          satisfaction of all parties. <b>This group is being formed. For now contact:</b>
        </p>
    
        <ul>
          <li>Nate Allen, @nate_allen on Slack</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
          If you encounter a conduct-related issue, you should report it to the
          Working Group using the process described below.
          <b>Do not</b> post about the issue publicly or try to rally sentiment against a
          particular individual or group.
        </p>
    
        <ul>
          <li>Report issues to members of the Working Group on the <a href="https://mobilebaytech.slack.com">MobileBayTech.org Slack</a> by sending a Direct Message.
            <ul>
              <li>Reports are confidential within the Working Group.</li>
              <li>Should you choose to remain anonymous then the Working Group cannot
                notify you of the outcome of your report.</li>
              <li>You may contact a member of the group directly if you do not feel
                comfortable contacting the group as a whole. That member will then raise
                the issue with the Working Group as a whole, preserving the privacy of the
                reporter (if desired).</li>
              <li>If your report concerns a member of the Working Group they will be recused
                from Working Group discussions of the report.</li>
              <li>The Working Group will strive to handle reports with discretion and
                sensitivity, to protect the privacy of the involved parties,
                and to avoid conflicts of interest.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>You should receive a response within 48 hours (likely sooner).
            (Should you choose to contact a single Working Group member,
            it may take longer to receive a response.)</li>
          <li>The Working Group will meet to review the incident and determine what happened.
            <ul>
              <li>With the permission of person reporting the incident, the Working Group
                may reach out to other community members for more context.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The Working Group will reach a decision as to how to act. These may include:
            <ul>
              <li>Nothing.</li>
              <li>A request for a private or public apology.</li>
              <li>A private or public warning.</li>
              <li>An imposed vacation (for instance, asking someone to abstain for a week
                from a mailing list or IRC).</li>
              <li>A permanent or temporary ban from some or all MobileBayTech.org spaces.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The Working Group will reach out to the original reporter to let them know
            the decision.</li>
          <li>Appeals to the decision may be made to the Working Group,
            or to any of its members directly.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
          <strong>Note that the goal of the Code of Conduct and the Working Group is to resolve
            conflicts in the most harmonious way possible.</strong>
          We hope that in most cases issues may be resolved through polite discussion and
          mutual agreement.
          Bannings and other forceful measures are to be employed only as a last resort.
        </p>
    
        <p>
